# üìà Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using real-world telecom customer data and supervised machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is critical for customer retention, helping businesses identify users likely to stop using their services.
We preprocess the data, handle missing values, balance classes using SMOTE, and explore a range of classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. 
We apply **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and evaluate models based on metrics like F1-score, recall, accuracy, and ROC AUC. The best-performing model is selected for final predictions and analysis.

## üöÄ Objectives

- Identify features most correlated with churn
- Handle missing and imbalanced data effectively
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
- Compare models using visualizations and metrics

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üîë Key Features
